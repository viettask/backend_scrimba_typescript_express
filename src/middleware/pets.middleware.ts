CHALLENGE: Create a `pleaseAuth` middleware
1. Write a standalone function called `pleaseAuth`
2. It should take req, res, and next
3. If query.password === "please", call next()
4. Otherwise, send a 401 with a message in JSON
5. Type req, res, and next
6. Attach this middleware to the `/:id` route
   
TESTS:
/pets/1 - should result in 401 Unauthorised error
/pets/1?password=please - we should get Bella the dog
