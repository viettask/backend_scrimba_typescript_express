title: 3 Things I Wish I Knew Before Using Docker

Docker is one of those tools that seems complicated at first, but once you start using it, you wonder how you ever built anything without it. Here are a few tips I wish I’d known when I started.

### 1. Containers Don’t Last Forever

Containers are meant to be short-lived. They spin up, run your app, and can be deleted without breaking anything. That means you should always keep your important data in **volumes** or in a database — never rely on the container’s internal files sticking around.

### 2. Use --rm During Development

When you’re experimenting and running containers over and over, your system can fill up with stopped containers you don’t need. Adding the `--rm` flag to `docker run` cleans them up automatically when they stop:

```docker run --rm -p 3000:3000 my-app```


### 3. Name Your Containers

This one’s simple but powerful. Instead of copying and pasting long container IDs, give them a name with `--name`. It makes every other command easier:

```
docker run --name blog -p 3000:3000 my-app
docker logs -f blog
docker exec -it blog sh
```

These small habits save you a ton of time — and they make Docker feel way less intimidating. Once you start using it every day, it becomes second nature.
